    "1. $h^*$ -- the minimum rupture patch length scale. It's good to know how this length scale compares to the size of the whole mesh. If the length scale is longest than the largest distance in the mesh, we do not expect to see ruptures in the model and after some initial slow slip events, the model should relax to a constant rate of creep despite the velocity weakening friction parameters. On the other hand, if the length scale is smaller than the largest distance in the mesh, we should expect to see ruptures. \n",
    "2. $L_b$ -- the cohesive zone length scale. It's nice to check before running a model to make sure that we are resolving the cohesive zone. For best accuracy, the mesh length scale should be less than half the cohesive zone. However, the results with a mesh length scale approximately equal to the cohesive zone length scale will be adequate. These constraints are looser than the requirements from previous methods (Lapusta and Liu 2009) because we are using a more accurate SGBEM implementation with sub-element linear variation in slip/traction.
