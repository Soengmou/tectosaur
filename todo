build table for adjacent interpolation
 -- should i remove the divergence? if yes, then the offset points don't need to be consistent between the adjacent and coincident integrals, i should check if different epsilon values give relatively consistent final results once the divergence is removed
 -- offset points need to take into account the adjacent elements and make sure there's no intersection

think about volume integrals -- only ever need to do volume integrals with U and A kernels --> no divergences, not even cauchy principal value integrals because the extra source dimension reduces the order of the singularity by one, still should do transformations to reduce the order of the singularity -- probably can remove it completely, in which case there are only some big 5 dimensional low order gauss integrals to do. alternatively, i could do another interpolation table... the adjacent trick would work

interior evaluation -- this is easy except near the surface, use sinh quadrature? test it against the adaptive quadrature. also, maybe i can just interpolate from one element length away to the surface value and avoid nearfield integrals?

try gauss for theta in coincident again? could speed things up.
can i get better than ~1e-5 error? with that error, the runtime for building the coincident table will probably be something like 12 hours on meade02.

actually use the interpolation table based integrals in an okada problem


use FMM for okada
-- just try it out first, make sure its accurate.
-- condense the columns of p2m and p2l and p2p, condense rows of m2p, l2p, p2p, this should increase efficiency A LOT (HUH??)

sphere test
-- do two problems:
  -- 1) impose displacement BCs and solve for traction on the boundary
  -- 2) vice-versa
-- interior evaluation.

CODE:

SCIENCE:
fault intersecting surface -- pretty much works
variety of boundary conditions
gravity
-- test the 3D kernels
play with time stepping combined with fault friction 
plasticity? the plastic opening condition, maybe a viscoplastic opening condition? the kinematic consistency idea from brendan is really interesting! compare with a FEM model of explicit volumetric plasticity

CORRECTNESS/BLACKBOXYNESS:
if i'm still using sinh_transform for interior evaluation, check that the b-distance(eps) is being computed properly
limit triangles to having angles > 20 degrees

METHOD:
sparse approximate inverse from FMM sparsity pattern
interior integrals for spatially varying body forces

OPTIMIZATIONS:
constraint construction
adjacency
figure out preconditioning, spilu is slow, but is there a better alternative? spai-based fmm inverse.
FMM via tree plan construction and gpu direct evaluation
multi GPU compatibility on meade02?
symmetric triangular quadrature rules:
