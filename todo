-- FMM via tree plan construction and gpu direct evaluation

-- actually use the interpolation table based integrals in an okada problem
-- what to do about interelement angles that are greater than pi, for adjacent table lookup?

use FMM for okada
-- just try it out first, make sure its accurate.

sphere test
-- do two problems:
  -- 1) impose displacement BCs and solve for traction on the boundary
  -- 2) vice-versa
-- interior evaluation.

-- interior evaluation -- this is easy except near the surface, use sinh quadrature? test it against the adaptive quadrature. also, maybe i can just interpolate from one element length away to the surface value and avoid nearfield integrals?
-- deal with low angle vertex adjacent cases -- these can be very expensive!

think about volume integrals -- only ever need to do volume integrals with U and A kernels --> no divergences, not even cauchy principal value integrals because the extra source dimension reduces the order of the singularity by one, still should do transformations to reduce the order of the singularity -- probably can remove it completely, in which case there are only some big 5 dimensional low order gauss integrals to do. alternatively, i could do another interpolation table... the adjacent trick would work


CODE:

SCIENCE:
fault intersecting surface -- pretty much works
variety of boundary conditions
gravity
-- test the 3D kernels
play with time stepping combined with fault friction 
plasticity? the plastic opening condition, maybe a viscoplastic opening condition? the kinematic consistency idea from brendan is really interesting! compare with a FEM model of explicit volumetric plasticity

CORRECTNESS/BLACKBOXYNESS:

METHOD:
sparse approximate inverse from FMM sparsity pattern
interior integrals for spatially varying body forces
2D
-- setup a golden master test matching with old 3bem results

OPTIMIZATIONS:
constraint construction
adjacency
figure out preconditioning, spilu is slow, but is there a better alternative? spai-based fmm inverse.
